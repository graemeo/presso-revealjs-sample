### Just to show off how cool this is

```python
import unittest

class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):

   def test_should_concat_these_strings_nicely(self):
      # given
      hello_string = "Hello"
      world_string = "World"
      
      expected = "HelloWorld"

      # when
      actual = hello_string + world_string

      # then
      self.assertEqual(actual, expected)
```

The above test case does not add any value...

Just trying to experiment how revealjs displays markdown content

### This is now the second slide of the presentation

You can create this in a separate markdown file itself, or...

... just add triple dashes in the same file followed by any contents - as a way to mark it as a new document
